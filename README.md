## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While coding this project i learned few things:

- Set up my work with Git and GitHub
- Using some google Fonts with "<link>"
- testing flexbox multiple times to get the result i want
- Using flexbox to center some blocks/div (using height & width)
- creating a small footer
- Writing the README file and insert screenshots
- Post my work on GitHub

### Continued development

For my next projects i'd like to go deeper with:

- Git & GitHub
